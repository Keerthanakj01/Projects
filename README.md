# Product Listing Page with Filtering and Searching

This JavaScript code displays a list of products with filtering and searching functionality. It allows users to view all products, filter by in-stock or out-of-stock products, and search for products by name. The code uses an array of product objects, each containing details such as image, name, processor, operating system, color, price, and in-stock status. The code provides a simple and interactive product listing page with filtering and searching capabilities.
